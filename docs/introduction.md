# ActiList - Interactive NFT Marketplace with Secret Auctions

Welcome to ActiList - interactive NFT marketplace where users can participate in auction sales bidding on interesting NFTs. ActiList provides a new gamified experience of puchasing NFT assets, and every bid has a chance of becoming the winning one.

ActiList is the first of its kind decentralized NFT marketplace providing unmatched level of data privacy to auction participants and perspective owners. Sensitive NFT metadata such as ownership details and transaction history are hidden by default, and only NFT owner can make this information public if there is a wish to do so. The same holds true for practically any NFT metadata. ActiList runs on Secret Network blockchain which is the state of the art infrastructure for running private computations. We value our user privacy and want our users to be the true owners of their data. 

Next to interactivity, privacy, and security, ActiList also shines in the marketing domain. It is a time consuming process to create art NFTs or any other valuable NFTs. That time can still be used by artists and creators to raise awareness of the product they are building. To support this there is an option to create an auction with a future start date. Auction would not start without a submitted NFT, but anyone interested could set a reminder to be notified about proceedings of the auction.

Since winning the hackathon and receiving the development grant from Secret Network in early 2022 our team has been busy implementing the very first type of NFT auction - Sealed Bid Auction. Now this is done and after successfull go-live around end of the year we will be gradually adding new auction types and improving overall user experience. For the next mayor changes we will be reaching out to the community to align development work with your expectations.
