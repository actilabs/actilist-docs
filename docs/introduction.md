# ActiList - Interactive NFT Marketplace with Secret Auctions

Welcome to ActiList - interactive NFT marketplace where users can bid on interesting NFTs and thus participate in auction sales. It is a gamified experience of puchasing NFT assets, and every bid has a chance of becoming the winning one.

ActiList is the first decentralized application that has implemented data privacy for NFT auctions. Any sensitive NFT metadata such as ownership and transaction history are hidden by default, and only NFT owner can make this information public if there is a wish to do so. ActiList runs on Secret Network blockchain ensuring absolute data privacy.
