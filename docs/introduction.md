# ActiList - Secret NFT Auctions

Welcome to the ActiList dapp featuring Secret NFT auctions. 
It has been our pleasure to pioneer privacy on blockchain as it is the most fundamental human right and makes users the true owners of their data.
Data privacy is fundamentally important and this applies in particular in the domain of NFTs. 
NFTs may contain a number of sensitive attributes such as ownership, transaction history, etc., that should not be publicly available unless NFT owner decides to reveal them to the public. 
As ActiList runs on Secret Network blockchain any sensitive NFT metadata such as ownership and transaction history can be hidden by default, 
but any attribute can be revealed to the public by NFT owner.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
