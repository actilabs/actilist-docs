# ActiList - Interactive NFT Marketplace with Secret Auctions

Welcome to ActiList - interactive NFT marketplace where users can get valuable NFTs for as much as they want.
With secret auctions at its core, anyone can participate in NFT auction sales It has been our pleasure to pioneer privacy on blockchain as it is the most fundamental human right and makes users the true owners of their data.
Data privacy is fundamentally important and this applies in particular in the domain of NFTs. 
NFTs may contain a number of sensitive attributes such as ownership, transaction history, etc., that should not be publicly available unless NFT owner decides to reveal them to the public. 
As ActiList runs on Secret Network blockchain any sensitive NFT metadata such as ownership and transaction history are hidden by default, 
but any attribute can be revealed to the public by NFT owner.
