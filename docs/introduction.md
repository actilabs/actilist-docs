# ActiList - Interactive NFT Marketplace with Secret Auctions and Access Control

Welcome to ActiList - the first interactive NFT marketplace with confidential bidding and customizable NFT access control. ActiList makes buying NFTs more interactive and engaging thanks to different types of auctions, and NFT owners for the first time have full access control over private sensitive attributes of their NFT assets.

ActiList is the first of its kind trustless NFT marketplace providing unmatched level of data privacy to auction participants and perspective owners. Sensitive NFT metadata such as ownership details and transaction history are hidden by default, and only NFT owners can make this information public if there is a wish to do so. The same holds true for any data stored inside NFT. Full access controll over private NFT attributes starts a new era of NFT development making NFTs more like containers of value which can represent any sensitive data making NFT utility almost limitless.

ActiList runs on Secret Network blockchain which is the state of the art infrastructure for running computations over encrypted data. Your private data inside NFT is encryted on hardware level with SGX technology and noone except you has access to it. You get to choose what you share, with whom, and how. Over time ActiList is going to provide portabilty for NFT assets from other popular blockhains, providing customizable privacy as additional feature to existing NFTs. We are privacy pioneers and want our users to be the true owners of their data. 

NFT auctions are making ActiList highly interactive and engaging place to buy and sell NFTs. Element of the game and uncertainty of the outcome are adding more energy to the process. Active users will be rewarded and there is always a chance of buying a valuable NFT for just a fraction of its market value. For NFT owners ActiList is going to be a reliable platform to promote their NFTs with the upcoming auctions. It is a time consuming process to create art NFTs or any other valuable NFTs. That time can still be used by artists and creators to raise awareness of the product they are building. To support this there is an option to create an auction with a future start date. Auction would not start without a submitted NFT, but anyone interested could set a reminder to be notified about proceedings of the auction.

Since winning the hackathon and receiving the development grant from Secret Network in early 2022 our team has been busy implementing the first type of NFT auction - Sealed Bid Auction. Now this is done and after successfull go-live around end of the year we will be gradually adding new auction types and improving overall user experience. For the next mayor changes we will be reaching out to community to align our development work with your expectations.
