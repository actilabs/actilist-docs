# Staking

The ActiList project is contributing to Secret Network's security and decentralization
by providing its own validator node. Building a decentralized application (dapp) that runs on Secret Network we are genuinely interested to keep network in a healthy state. 
Therefore we take best care of our validator node to make sure it runs smoothly in any circumstance. 

Our efforts among other include:

- Automatic node monitoring and alerting 
- Ongoing node performance tuning 
- Timely upgrades

You may consider delegating SCRT tokens to ActiList validator to support ongoing work on ActiList dapp and enjoy multiple benefits:

- Above average staking rewards
- Airdrop of ACTI tokens
