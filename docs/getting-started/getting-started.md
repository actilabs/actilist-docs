## Sealed Bid Auction

There are lots of different types of auctions. One of those is what's called a sealed bid auction. What is a sealed bid auction? It is simply a "blind" auction if you want to think of it that way where potential buyers submit bids simultaneusly without knowing about other potential buyers' bids. So in a traditional auction we think of different people offering to spend more money in order to bid out the other people and actually buy the product. In a blind auction you don't know what anybody else is bidding. The highest bid still wins, but because you don't know what anybody else is offering it tends to discourage people from low-balling or going very low with their offer because they want to actually win the product or the auction. So in some cases this can actually drive up the amount that people offer or spend on products. Depending on the particular NFT product or type of customer that you are looking for you may decide that a sealed bid auction is the way for you to sell your NFT product.
