Applying search filers may be helpful in finding relevant auctions sales. Open interesting auction to start interacting with it. From the same detail view you may conviniently navigate to the next auctions with left and right arrows. Like this it should be convenient to perform the same action on multiple auctions.  

### 2. Place a Bid

You can place a bid that is equal or greater than the minimum bid. Bid currency token may be different from auction to auction. Make sure you have sufficient amount of bid tokens in your crypto wallet. ActiList has been tested to work reliably with Keplr wallet, which is the most popular crypto wallet for cosmos ecosystem blockchains. Simply type in the amount of tokens you would like to spend on the particular NFT and submit by pressing bid button. You will be prompted by your wallet in order to sign the transaction. The cost of transaction is a fraction of a cent and it is paid in SCRT - the native currency token of Secret Network. If you change your mind you can retract your bid and return paid tokens as long as auction is live. Also it possible to change your bid by bidding again. When bidding again, previous bid token are automatically returned to your wallet.
